Just a simple tool that generates the number of colors desired with equal hue spacing and two variants.
To be used for example during web design when there's a need to have a range of user-selectable colors that are easy to tell apart and might affect the UI at a few different places. Or, another example when there's a need to assign a different color for each user on a collaborative environment such as a chat or applications similar to Microsoft's or Google's office tools when used with online collaborators.
